  * Any household who are aware of the vast amount of
plastic used in daily products and want to reduce their footprints.

* to be able to add, change a code for discount coupons. This can be done through the admin console on the website 

## **Design Choices**
---
I tried to create a overall user friendly design with EcoShop website. I wanted to encoruge the user to shop with confidence with that in mind I attempt to use a common ecommerce website structure.

### **Wireframes**
* Wireframes were created using balsamiq.you can find them [here](./readme-doc/wireframe)

### **Fonts**
* For the primary font I used GoogleFonts PT+Serif as a main font and Lora for headings I thought it would fit with the website. 

### **Colour**
![(readme-doc/EcoShoppalette.png)](readme-doc/EcoShoppalette.png)

* I have created the color palette using the hero image on the website with [colors.co](https://coolors.co/006d77-83c5be-edf6f9-ffddd2-e29578) palette creator for holistic view. Try to keep the colours consistent to 
* I used the _Darksalmon_ on the buttons, _Ming_ colour for heading and logo, _Bistre_ for font colour, _Seashell_ for footer and About sections.

### **Styling**
* The brand logo is important as it welcomes the customer when they land in to the website. I created the logo to represent nature and elegance using Canva website. 
* All buttons on the site fit the same bootstrap button styling in size and shape, but I added the colours I used in this project to them so they fit in with the rest of the content.
* Material Design for bootstrab `MDB` Card design used on Products page included _Add Cart_.The card shows image and price of the product.


## **Features**
---
### **Element on every page**

* **Top Header**
    * On the left of the header you can see the brand logo
    ![(media/EcoShopLogo.png)](media/EcoShopLogo.png)
    * Links for the users and search bar on the middle range and the _All Product_ which is a dropdown take you to product page andsort the products in range such as `By Price`, `By Category`. _Categories_ such as `Kitchen`. 
    * The navbar is collapsed into a burger icon on small and medium sized screens and the logo disappears there fore _Home_ button appears on the dropdown menu
    * Search box function allows the visitors to search the products on online shop with keywords. The keywords are searched over name and description field of Product Model. it collapses to magnified icon on small and medium sized screens.
    * On the right corner there is user icon it is a dropdown button gives `Register` and `Login` options if the user is logged in `My Profile` and `Logout`. If the user is superuser `Product Management ` option will also appear.

* **Footer**
  * Logo which is link to the home page
  * A list of navigation links users might need when viewing the footer.
  * Copyright information.
  * Social media links they are not linked at the moment but I will add them once the EcoShop social media platforms are exist.


### **Existing Features**
### **Home Page**
The homepage is the most visited place in the webstore. Itâ€™s the page from where the customers start exploring the storefront. I want to excite the customers with my homepage content by highlighting my best-selling product, special offer and new items.
To fulfil that purpose I added 20% discount modal, new arrival row and popular categories row.  
* A modal pops up in 3 second, gives enough time to the user a glimpse of the page before the modal pops in.
* Homepage welcomes the user with free delivery treshold banner and navigation bar.
* Hero image choosed from [canva](canva.com) There is a motto emphases "why you should shop on this website" and a `Shop Now` button completes the image.
* New arrival row I added a line of codeto `home` app `views.py`  which calls last added 4 items to the website.
* About us section intraduce the site to the visitor 
* Popular categories is inprogress part of the page. It is static at the moment but in future will call the most clicked categories to the home page.
### **Product Page**
 You can come to this page either `Shop Now` button on the home page or `All Products` link from the navigation bar. Also you can see categorised version  


### **Features Left to Implement**



## **Technologies Used**

  * HTML


  * CSS


  * Javascript 


  * JQuery  Used for some of the main javascript functionality.

 

  * [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)


  * [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) *Lato*, *Oswald*, *Monoton*


  
  * [Fontawsome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the event categories icon.


  * [Materializecss](https://materializecss.com/) for the designing the card and footer.

  
### **Back-End Technologies**
* Flask - Used as the microframework.
* Jinja - template to simplify displaying data from the backend of this project smoothly and effectively in html.
* Heroku - Used to host the application
* Python - The back-end programming language.
* Pymongo - Used to connect the python with the database.
* MongoDB Atlas - Used to store the database.
* PIP - for installation of tools needed in this project.


### **Database Schema**
The application uses MongoDB for data storage. MongoDB was chosen as the database to use due to the unstructured format of the data that will be stored within it.  
The data stored in the database are the following:

* Object  
* String  
* Array  
### **Data structure**  

#### Event_categories  
| Title         | 	Key in db	    |  Data type |  
| ------------- |:-----------------:|-----------:|
| event_id      |      _id          |ObjectId    | 
| event_name    | Event name        |String      | 
| event_picture | path to the image |String      |

#### Events

| Title             | Key in bd         | Data     |
| -------------     |:-----------------:| --------:|
| event_id          | _id               | ObjectId |

## **Testing**
[W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).  


 [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

[JSHint](https://jshint.com/) 
I tested Python code with PEP8 using it as follow:

The autopep8 extension was installed in the workspace.

To install this enter this in the terminal:
`pip3 install --upgrade autopep8`
In order for autopep8 to run, pycodestyle is also required. To instlal pycodestyle, enter this command into the terminal:

`pip3 install pycodestyle`
Once these steps are complete, you can format the code into PEP8 formatting by entering this command into the terminal:

`autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive app.py`

I have recieved no error in the end of testing

## Bugs

## **Deployment**
#### To run this project locally

In order to run this project locally, you will need to install the following:

An IDE, such as VS Code
PIP to install the app requirements.
Python3 to run the application
GIT for version control
MongoDB to develop the database.
Once this is done, you will need to download the .ZIP file of the repository, unzip this file and then in the CLI with GIT installed, enter the following command:

`https://github.com/ozluna/meet-eco.git` 
Navigate to the to path using the cd command.

Create a .env file with your credentials. Be sure to include your MONGO_URI and SECRET_KEY values.

Install all requirements from the requirements.txt file using the following command:

  `sudo -H pip3 -r requirements.txt`


You should then be able to launch your app using the following command in your terminal:

  `python app.py`

## Remote Deployment
* Create a `requirements.txt` file using the terminal command  `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt` .
* Create a Procfile with the terminal command `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`.
* `git add` and `git commit` the new requirements and Procfile and then `git push` the project to GitHub.
* Head over to Heroku
* Click the "new" button, give the project a name & set the region to Europe.
* From the Heroku dashboard of your newly created application, click on `"Deploy" > "Deployment method"` and select GitHub.
* Confirm the linking of the Heroku app to the correct GitHub repository.
* In the Heroku dashboard for the application, click on "Settings" > "Reveal Config Vars".
* Set the following config vars:

| KEY           | VALUE                              | 
| ------------- |:----------------------------------:|
| IP            | 0.0.0.0                            | 
| PORT          | 5000                               |  
| MONGODBNAME   | <database_name>                    | 
| MONGO_URI     |mongodb+srv://:@<cluster_name> -qtxun.mongodb.net/<database_name> ?retryWrites=true&w=majority |              
| SECRET KEY    | `<your_secret_key>`                 |
